# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project delves into the fundamental concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. These concepts are crucial for understanding memory manipulation and data storage in C.

## Task 0: 98 Battery st.

Implement a function `reset_to_98` that updates the value of an integer variable to 98.

## Task 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Create a function `swap_int` to swap the values of two integer variables.

## Task 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Develop a function `_strlen` that calculates and returns the length of a given string.

## Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them

Craft the `_puts` function to print a given string followed by a newline character.

## Task 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear

Write the `print_rev` function to print a given string in reverse order followed by a newline.

## Task 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes

Implement the `rev_string` function to reverse the characters of a string in place.

## Task 6: Half the lies they tell about me aren't true

Create the `puts2` function to print every other character of a string, starting from the first character.

## Task 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half

Design the `puts_half` function to print the second half of a string, or the last n characters if the length is odd.

## Task 8: Arrays are not pointers

Develop the `print_array` function to print the elements of an integer array up to a specified number, separated by commas.

## Task 9: strcpy

Implement the `_strcpy` function to copy a source string into a destination buffer, including the null terminator.
